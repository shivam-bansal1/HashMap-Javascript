# HashMap & HashSet
HashMap and HashSet implementation with JavaScript

## Features
- `hash(key)` takes a key and produces a hash code with it.
- `set(key, value)` takes two arguments: the first is a key, and the second is a value that is assigned to this key. If a key already exists, then the old value is overwritten.
- `get(key)` takes one argument as a key and returns the value that is assigned to this key. If a key is not found, return null.
- `has(key)` takes a key as an argument and returns true or false based on whether or not the key is in the hash map.
- `remove(key)` takes a key as an argument. If the given key is in the hash map, it should remove the entry with that key and return true. If the key isnâ€™t in the hash map, it should return false.
- `length()` returns the number of stored keys in the hash map.
- `clear()` removes all entries in the hash map.
- `keys()` returns an array containing all the keys inside the hash map.
- `values()` returns an array containing all the values.
- `entries()` returns an array that contains each key, value pair. Example: [[firstKey, firstValue], [secondKey, secondValue]]
